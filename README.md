# Monster Variants Plus

An addon designed to work alongside [Rob's Monster Variants](https://github.com/ArcPh1r3/MonsterVariants) Mod.

This Github is where you can check out the current work made inside Monster Variants Plus (Abreviated to MV+ from now on) as Nebby works on the next update.

## Code
All the code written here can be used for your own purposes as long as it isnt commercial, all of my work wouldn't be a thing if it wheren't for the help i've recived from other modders via letting me borrow some of their code.

That said, ideally do give credit if you plan on taking a snippet of code from this github for your own purposes.

## Bug Reports
All types of Bug Reports are to be sent to this github's Issue page. Please report these bugs under their correct labels for the sake of organization, these labels being:
###  Feature Bugs
Bugs related to the mod's Features, such as it's Rewards systems.
###  Variant Bugs
Bugs related to the mod's Variants, such as the AD-Shroom or the Incinerating Elder Lemurian.
## Suggestions
I do take suggestions in the form of new features or new variants, but please, instead of messaging me on discord, please submit them in the Issue page alongside it's corresponding label.
### Feature Idea
### Variant Idea
Suggestions that are sent to my Discord dm's are no longer accepted, due to the difficulty of tracking them down and keeping them organized.
## Wiki
While this Github's wiki page is currently pretty barebones, in the future i plan on having that place where you can find all the information you need about my custom variants, or the features of the mod.
This is to start cutting down on the size of the Thunderstore's Markdown readme file.
