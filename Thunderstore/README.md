# MonsterVariantsPlus
- An Addon for Rob's [MonsterVariants](https://thunderstore.io/package/rob/MonsterVariants/)
- Adds Custom Variants on top of Rob's Existing Variants
- Killing a Variant now Gives rewards Depending on their Tier (Common, Uncommon & Rare)
- (Note, Tiers are not mentioned in Rob's page, each Variant has a Tier assigned to it which cannot be changed via configuration.)
- Rewards include Extra gold based off a Multiplier, Extra XP based off a Multiplier, & a Chance for an item to drop from the Variant (As if the Artifact of Sacrifice was Active).
- Rewards Configurable, including the Gold Multiplier, the XP Multiplier, & the Item drop chances.

## Features

### Gold Bonus

- Receive extra gold when killing a Variant, based off a Multiplier & the Variant's Tier. Values are fully Configurable.

Default Values:

	- 1.3 for Common Variants
	- 1.6 for Uncommon Variants
	- 2.0 for Rare Variants

- For more information regarding the Gold Bonus, such as how it works and it's default values, check out it's wiki page. [Link](https://github.com/Nebby1999/MonsterVariantsPlus/wiki/Gold-Reward-System)

### XP Bonus

---

- Receive extra XP when killing a Variant, based off a Multiplier & the Variant's Tier. Values are fully Configurable.

	- 1.3 for Common Variants
	- 1.6 for Uncommon Variants

### Item Drops

---

- Each time you kill a Variant, there's a small chance for it to drop an Item which's tier can be White, Green or Red.
- Chances are highly configurable, and each Tier has it's own chances. (drop chances are not affected by the Luck stat).

Default Values:

	Common Variants:
	- 3% for a White item
	- 0% for a Green item
	- 0% for a Red item
	
	Uncommon Variants:
	- 5% for a White item
	- 1% for a Green item
	- 0% for a Red Item
	
	Rare Variants:
	- 10% for a White Item
	- 5% for a Green Item
	- 1% for a Red Item

- To avoid the player farming items inside hidden realms, a special config entry exists to determine how the mod calculates the chances for an item drop.

The Settings are:	
	
	- Unchanged:No changes are made.
	- Halved: When the variant dies, there's a 50% Chance the mod will roll the dice to determine wether or not an item spawns.
	- Never: Variants never drop items in hidden realms.

It is highly recommended that you check out it's Wiki page, since there you can find a better explanation of how the item drop mechanic works. [Link](https://github.com/Nebby1999/MonsterVariantsPlus/wiki/Item-Reward-System)

- Monster Variants Plus adds new Variants to the game

- The end goal is to have at least one variant per type of enemy.

- Just Like in the Original Monster Variants, their spawn chance can be changed in the config file.

- All of my variants have custom names, so if you find a new one, you can ping it and it's name will show up.

- If you don't want any new variants, you can also disable the entire section in the config file.

- Due to the increasing list of variants, from now on only their Names and it's spawn chances will apear in the list below, you can check out the MonsterVariantsPlus wiki for all the details regarding the new Variants. [Link](https://github.com/Nebby1999/MonsterVariantsPlus/wiki/Enemy-Variants#enemy-list)

- Or you can click a variant's name and a new browser tab will open up with it's wiki entry.

### Artifact of Variance
![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/461597592825102369/843631169102020658/VarianceEnabled.png)

- MVP Adds a new artifact called the Artifact of Variance

- The Artifact causes all monster variants spawn rates to be multiplied by 2

- Multiplication number can be increased in the Config File

- Has an option for increasing rewards alongside spawn rate (Disabled by default).

- More information can be found in it's respective wiki page. [Link](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/461597592825102369/843631169102020658/VarianceEnabled.png)

## Installation
- To install the addon, simply drag the MonsterVariantsPlus.dll onto your plugins folder. Make sure Rob's DLL is also there, or else the plugin will not activate.

## Known Issues
- The Ichor Imp's Material causes the imp to have a weird blotch of yellow on its back, no clue what causes this.

## Future Plans
- Have Boss variants drop their Boss item based off Chance.
- Create actually pleasing to the eyes textures for the variants instead of the awful look of some of them *cough cough* Alpha Bison *cough cough*
- Wait for Rob to implement DeathState replacers to replace the Wisp Amalgamate's death behavior instead of using a hook, which would increase performance overall.
- Make some wizardry to improve the Wisp Amalgamate's Death explosion & it's light emmiting properties so they arent green.

## Contacting
In case you need to report a bug, please do so using Github's Issue Tracker found [Here](https://github.com/Nebby1999/MonsterVariantsPlus/issues)
In case you have a suggestion for a variant, please suggest it in the Github's issue tracker using the correct label. I am no longer taking variant suggestions via discord.
I also hang out in the Official [Risk of Rain 2 Modding](https://discord.gg/5MbXZvd) Discord Server under the name of "Nebby" in case you want to contact me for other purposes.
